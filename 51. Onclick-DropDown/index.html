            Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites 
            and web applications for the internet. It involves a range of tasks, 
            including designing the visual layout of web pages, coding the functionality 
            and interactivity of websites, and ensuring that the sites are user-friendly 
            and optimized for performance.

            Key differences between Java and JavaScript: Java is an OOP
            programming language while Java Script is an OOP scripting language.
            Java creates applications that run in a virtual machine or browser
            while JavaScript code is run on a browser only. Java code needs to
            be compiled while JavaScript code are all in text.

            You do not need to know Java to learn JavaScript. Despite their
            names, the two languages have very little in common and are used for
            completely different areas of development. You can learn either
            language first but learning Java is not a prerequisite to picking up
            JavaScript

            ES5 and ES6 are two 
            different versions of the JavaScript language, each with 
            its own features and improvements. ES5 was introduced in 2009 and 
            represented a significant update to the JavaScript language. ES6, released 
            in 2015, brought significant enhancements to the language, making JavaScript 
            more powerful and expressive.
